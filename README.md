A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. 

The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and the bottom-most nodes are called leaves. A binary tree can be visualized as a hierarchical structure with the root at the top and the leaves at the bottom.

Binary trees have many applications in computer science, including data storage and retrieval, expression evaluation, network routing, and game AI. They can also be used to implement various algorithms such as searching, sorting, and graph algorithms.

Representation of Binary Tree:
Each node in the tree contains the following:

Data
Pointer to the left child
Pointer to the right child
Binary Tree

In C, we can represent a tree node using structures. In other languages, we can use classes as part of their OOP feature. Below is an example of a tree node with integer data.
