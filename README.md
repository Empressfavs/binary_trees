Binary Tree Project
About
Welcome to the Binary Tree Project! This project is a collaborative effort by Favour and Kabiru to implement a binary tree data structure in C.

Description
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are commonly used in computer science for tasks such as searching, sorting, and organizing data efficiently.

Goals
Implement basic binary tree operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Explore advanced binary tree concepts such as balancing algorithms.
Develop a comprehensive understanding of binary trees and their applications.
Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you're interested in adding new features, fixing bugs, or optimizing code, feel free to get involved. Check out the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more information on how to contribute.

Usage
To use the binary tree implementation in your own projects, simply clone this repository and include the necessary files in your project directory. Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on how to instantiate and utilize binary trees in your code.
